# WebTestPage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## About the legacy code

1. **Inconsistent Color Scheme**: A prominent issue lies in the website's inconsistent color scheme, which encompasses more than ten disparate colors that lack a unifying theme. This inconsistency compromises the website's ability to establish a coherent visual hierarchy and hinders users from grasping the relationships between various page elements.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: We propose the implementation of a standardized color palette, incorporating a limited selection of complementary colors. This approach aims to create visual harmony, aligning with principles of color psychology to evoke the desired emotions and enhance user engagement.

2. **Lack of Visual Hierarchy**: The absence of a discernible visual hierarchy on the website leads to user confusion. Critical elements become obscured within a cluttered layout, making it challenging for users to locate and concentrate on pivotal content.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: To mitigate this issue, we suggest the use of typographic hierarchies, precise spacing, and strategically contrasting colors. This approach guides the user's gaze toward crucial elements and content, subsequently enhancing readability and user comprehension.

3. **Non-Componetized Design**: The website's design fails to adopt a component-based approach, resulting in redundancy and inconsistencies throughout the user interface. This lack of modularity presents obstacles in terms of efficient maintenance and scalability.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: To address these challenges, we recommend implementing a comprehensive design system, which incorporates reusable UI components. This framework ensures consistency across the platform and simplifies future design and development endeavors.

4. **Unintuitive Navigation**: The website's navigation structure is notably disorganized, complicating the user's ability to navigate the platform. Users are left to navigate ambiguously, struggling to locate essential information.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: In response, we advocate a comprehensive redesign of the website's information architecture. This redesign should feature a clear and intuitive navigation menu, categorizing related content, and leveraging breadcrumbs to assist users in tracking their path through the site.

5. **Cluttered Layout**: The website's layout is overly congested, with an excess of elements competing for attention. This situation results in a chaotic user experience and a palpable absence of visual breathing space.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: To address this challenge, we recommend adopting a minimalist approach to layout design. This approach entails reducing superfluous elements and optimizing content spacing, ensuring a clean and organized content presentation that promotes improved readability.

6. **Performance Optimization**: The website exhibits sluggish load times, primarily due to an overabundance of non-optimized media and heavy code. These issues have a detrimental impact on both user experience and search engine optimization (SEO).

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: We propose the implementation of performance optimization strategies, including image compression, the minification of CSS and JavaScript files, and consideration of content delivery networks (CDNs). These measures collectively contribute to improved loading speed and overall platform performance.

7. **Accessibility Concerns**: The website lacks essential accessibility features, rendering it inaccessible to users with disabilities. This deficiency represents a substantial violation of web accessibility standards and may result in legal consequences.

   **Recommendation for Improvement**: To address this critical concern, we strongly recommend aligning the website with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This entails providing alternative text for images, enhancing keyboard navigation, and resolving other accessibility issues to ensure a more inclusive online experience.
